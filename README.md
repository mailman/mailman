# Mailman [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mailman/mailman.png)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mailman/mailman)

Mailman is an incoming mail processing microframework (with POP3 and Maildir
support), that works with Rails "out of the box".

```ruby
require 'mailman'
Mailman::Application.run do
  to 'ticket-%id%@example.org' doâ€¨
    Ticket.find(params[:id]).add_reply(message)
  end
end
```
