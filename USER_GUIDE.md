# Mailman User Guide

Mailman is a microframework for processing incoming email.

Here is an example Mailman app that takes incoming messages to a support
email account, and adds them to a database.

    # mailman_app.rb
    require 'mailman'

    Mailman.config.maildir = '~/Maildir'

    Mailman::Application.run do
      to 'support@example.org' do
        Ticket.new_from_message(message)
      end
    end

The Mailman app could then be started by running `ruby mailman_app.rb`.

## Installation

Installation is as simple as `gem install mailman`.


## Routes & Conditions

A **Condition** specifies the part of the message to match against. `to`,
`from`, and `subject` are some valid conditions. A **Matcher** is used by a
condition to determine whether it matches the message. Matchers can be
strings or regular expressions. One or more Condition/Matcher pairs are
combined with a block of code to form a **Route**.

### Matchers

There are string and regular expression matchers. Both can perform captures.

#### String

String matchers are very simple. They search through a whole field for a
specific substring. For instance: `'ID'` would match `Ticket ID`, `User ID`,
etc.

They can also perform named captures. `'%username%@example.org'` will match any
email address that ends with `@example.org`, and store the user part of the
address in a capture called `username`. Captures can be accessed by using
the `params` helper inside of blocks, or with block arguments (see below for
details).

The capture names may only contain letters and underscores. Behind the scenes
they are compiled to regular expressions, and each capture is the equivalent to
`.*`. There is currently no way to escape `%` characters. If a literal `%` is
required, and Mailman thinks it is a named capture, use a regular expression
matcher instead.

#### Regular expression

Regular expressions may be used as matchers. All captures will be available from
the params helper (`params[:captures]`) as an Array, and as block arguments.


### Routes

Routes are defined within a Mailman application block:

    Mailman::Application.run do
      # routes here
    end

Messages are passed through routes in the order they are defined in the
application from top to bottom. The first matching route's block will be
called.

#### Condition Chaining

Conditions can be chained so that the route will only be executed if all
conditions pass:

    to('support@example.org').subject(/urgent/) do
      # process urgent message here
    end

#### Special routes

The `default` route is a catch-all that is run if no other routes match:

    default do
      # process non-matching messages
    end

#### Block Arguments

All captures from matchers are available as block arguments:

    from('%user%@example.org').subject(/Ticket (\d+)/) do |username, ticket_id|
      puts "Got message from #{username} about Ticket #{ticket_id}"
    end

#### Class Routing

Messages can also be routed to methods. For instance, to route to an
Object with a `receive` instance method defined, this will work:

    from '%user%@example.org', Sample

Messages can also be routed to arbitrary instance methods:

    from '%user%@example.org', 'ExampleClass#new_message'

The method should accept two arguments, the message object, and the params:

    def receive(message, params)
      # process message here
    end

#### Route Helpers

There are two helpers available inside of route blocks:

The `params` hash holds all captures from matchers:

    from('%user%@example.org').subject(/RE: (.*)/) do
      params[:user] #=> 'chunkybacon'
      # it is an indifferent hash, so you can use strings and symbols
      # interchangeably as keys
      params['captures'][0] #=> 'A very important message about pigs'
    end

The `message` helper is a `Mail::Message` object that contains the entire
message. See the [mail](http://github.com/mikel/mail/) docs for information on
the properties available.


### Conditions

Currently there are five conditions available: `to`, `from`, `cc`, `subject`, `body`

More can be added easily (see `lib/mailman/route/conditions.rb`).


## Receivers

There are currently three types of receivers in Mailman: Standard Input,
Maildir, and POP3. If IMAP or any complex setups are required, use a mail
retriever like [getmail](http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/) with the
Maildir receiver.


### Standard Input

If a message is piped to a Mailman app, this receiver will override any
configured receivers. The app will process the message, and then quit. This
receiver is useful for testing and debugging. This feature can be disabled
with the `Mailman.config.ignore_stdin` option.

**Example**: `cat plain_message.eml | ruby mailman_app.rb`


### POP3

The POP3 receiver is enabled when the `Mailman.config.pop3` hash is set. It
will poll every minute by default (this can be changed with
`Mailman.config.poll_interval`). After new messages are processed, they will
be deleted from the server. *No copy of messages will be saved anywhere
after processing*. If you want to keep a copy of messages, it is recommended
that you use a mail retriever with the Maildir receiver. You could also use
Gmail and set it to keep messages after they have been retrieved with POP3.


### Maildir

The Maildir receiver is enabled when `Mailman.config.maildir` is set to a
directory. If the `cur`, `new`, and `tmp` folders do not already exist in
the folder, they will be created. All messages in `new` folder will be
processed when the application launches, then moved to the `cur` folder, and
marked as seen. After processing these messages, Mailman will use the
[fssm](http://github.com/ttilley/fssm) gem to monitor the `new` folder, and
process messages as they are created.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in the `Mailman.config` object. All paths are
relative to the process's working directory or absolute if starting with a
`/`.


### Logging

`Mailman.config.logger` can be set to a `Logger` instance. You should
change this if you want to log to a file in production.

**Example**: `Mailman.config.logger = Logger.new('logs/mailman.log')`

**Default**: `Logger.new(STDOUT)`


### POP3 Receiver

`Mailman.config.pop3` stores an optional POP3 configuration hash. If it is
set, Mailman will use POP3 polling as the receiver.

**Example**:

    Mailman.config.pop3 = {
      :username => 'chunkybacon@gmail.com',
      :password => 'foobar',
      :server   => 'pop.gmail.com',
      :port     => 995, # defaults to 110
      :ssl      => true # defaults to false
    }


### Polling

`Mailman.config.poll_interval` is the duration in seconds to wait between
checking for new messages on the server. It is currently only used by the
POP3 reciever. If it is set to `0`, Mailman will do a one-time retrieval and
then exit.

**Default**: `60`


### Maildir

`Mailman.config.maildir` is the location of a Maildir folder to watch. If it
is set, Mailman will use Maildir watching as the receiver.

**Example**: `Mailman.config.maildir = '~/Maildir'`


### Rails

`Mailman.config.rails_root` is the location of the root of a Rails app to
load the environment from. If this option is set to `nil`, Rails environment
loading will be disabled.

**Default**: `'.'`

### Standard input receiver

`Mailman.config.ignore_stdin` disables the STDIN receiver, which can
interfere with running Mailman with cron or as a daemon.

**Default**: `false`

### Graceful death

`Mailman.config.graceful_death`, if set, will catch SIGINTs 
(Control-C) and allow the mail receiver to finish its current
iteration before exiting. Note that this currently only works
with POP3 receivers.
